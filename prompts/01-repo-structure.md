You are designing a new .NET backend repo named StarTracker.

Constraints:
- Use .NET 8, C#, minimal dependencies, nullable enabled.
- Architecture: Api/Core/Infrastructure/Tests.
- Keep it suitable for a Level 1 backend developer portfolio: clean, readable, not over-engineered.
- Provide the folder structure and the initial minimal set of files with reasons.

Output:
1) Folder tree
2) List of initial projects and references
3) Minimal boilerplate for Program.cs and DI composition
4) README outline (short)
